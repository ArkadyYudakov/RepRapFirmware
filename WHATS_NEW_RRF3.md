RepRapFirmware 3.2RC1
=====================

Upgrade notes:
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] You must update the expansion and/or tool board firmware to 3.2RC1 also
- [DUET + SBC] The SPI protocol has changed, therefore versions of DCS prior to 3.2RC1 will be unable to communicate with this version of RRF
- [DWC] If you are running DWC in a development environment (e.g. via `npm run serve`), use [M586 C"*"](https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M586_Configure_network_protocols) or similar to permit cross-origin HTTP access 

Known issues:
- [Duet + SBC] The "files" command does not work in menu files for 12864 displays

New features:
- New M595 command is provided to increase the length of the movement queue and to pre-allocate DriveMovement objects
- The number of DriveMovement objects pre-allocated is reduced to save memory. If the system runs out of DrivemMovement objects, it will try to allocate new ones dynamically.
- DDAs and DriveMovement objects are now alocated from a non-freeable memory pool to reduce memory overhead, saving several hundred bytes of RAM
- CORS headers are only sent in HTTP responses if explictly configured via M586. The M586 command now accepts a C parameter to specify the allowed cross-origin site.
- Added aux port diagnostics (overrun and framing errors) to M122 report
- [Duet 3 Mini] Added data cache hit count to M122 report
- [Duet + SBC] 12864 displays are now supported (but see under Known Issues)

Bug fixes:
- Fixed crash that occured on some systems when M918 was used to configure a 12864 display but no SD card was present
- After updating PanelDue firmware with M997 S4 the PanelDue did not always reset automatically
- If M997 S4 was used but no aux port was configured, the firmware could reset after 20 seconds
- [Duet 3 MB6HC] Fixed an issue that very occasionally caused a MemoryProtectionFault from the Ethernet task

RepRapFirmware 3.2-beta4.1
==========================

Upgrade notes:
- **Update 2012-12-03**: the binaries for the tool and expansion boards have been updated to versoin 3.2beta4.1, to fix a stack overflow when a heater fault occurs on a Duet 3 tool or expansion board
- ~~Only the main board binaries have changed since beta4. Tool/expansion board binaries,~~ DuetWiFiServer and DWC are the same as in beta4.
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] You must update expansion/tool board firmware to the ~~3.2beta4~~ **3.2beta4.1** binaries, which are included in this release

Known issues:
- [Duet 2 + 12864 display] There is insufficient free RAM to run Duet WiFi/Ethernet with 12864 display

New features:
- Version 3 PanelDue boards (including all PanelDue 5i/7i) can now be updated from the Duet using M997 S4
- The heater tuning algorithm has been improved for the case where the heating system had a large thermal reservoir that was somewhat decoupled from the temperature sensor (e.g. silicone bed heaters with built-in thermistors)
- The M203 command now supports an optional S1 parameter which changes the units to mm/sec. The default is still mm/min.
- [Duet 2 Ethernet/WiFi/Maestro] Duet 2 builds now permit port names to have a "0." prefix, e.g. "0.e0heat". The "0." prefix is ignored.
- [Duet 3 Mini only] If M918 P1 is used then the pin labelled A0 is now uses as the chip select (CS) pin instead of pin SPI2_CS3

Bug fixes:
- When a GCode file included very short moves, sometimes the print paused for a time (sometimes a very long time) at that point
- M918 P0 reported an error instead of just deleting any existing display
- [Duet 3 + SBC + tool/expansion boards] It was not possible to update tool or expansion board firmware when a SBC was connected
- [Duet 3 + SBC] When file daemon.g was requested, spurious warning messages could be displayed

RepRapFirmware 3.2-beta4
========================

Upgrade notes:
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] You must update expansion/tool board firmware to 3.2beta4 as well

Known issues:
- [Duet 2 + 12864 display] There is insufficient free RAM to run Duet WiFi/Ethernet with 12864 display
- [Duet 3 + tool/expansion boards] If you update tool or expansion board firmware, or reboot a tool or expansion board using M999 B#, you must restart the system afterwards so that the updated or reset board(s) get re-initialised from the commands in config.g

New features:
- WiFi diagnostics now include the WiFi connection mode (needs DuetWiFiServer 1.25beta0)
- [Duet 3 tool boards] Stepper driver diagnostics now include the PWM_AUTO register (main board diagnostics did already)
- [Duet 3] CAN diagnostics on both main and tool/expansion boards provide more data
- M308 S# H999 and L999 are now supported on those Duet 3 expansion/tool boards that have the required hardware support
- The order in which you use M307, M140, M141 and M143 is now immaterial

Bug fixes:
- Tool and expansion board firmware was likely to crash if a sensor or heater fault occurred (new bug in 3.2beta3 and beta3.2)
- The heater tuning algorithm could fail to properly measure the dead time if it was very low (thanks Andy)
- M226, M600 and M601 got stuck in state "Pausing" (new bug in 3.2beta3)
- If a TMC22xx driver received two commands to enable/disable the drive or change microstepping twice in very quick succession, the second one was sometimes lost
- In Marlin mode, "ok" was returned per-command instead of per line of GCode
- M118 P0 didn't append newline when the message was sent to USB and Telnet
- Incorrect M307 default parameters were used for bed and chamber heaters
- At the very end of a print job, RRF sometimes briefly reported a bad file position, which caused DWC to report a very high % completed
- [Duet 3] CAN diagnostics incorrectly reported most transmissions as having timed out
- [Duet 3 MB6HC] A watchdog timeout didn't save any software reset data
- [Duet 3 expansion/tool boards] If a filament monitor was configured, the expansion/tool board sent a continuous stream of status messages to the main board after the first change in filament monitor status (e.g. when the first data packet was received from a Duet3D laser or magnetic filament monitor). This had a detrimental effect on print quality.
- [Duet 3 expansion/tool boards] CAN diagnostics incorrectly reported a large number of messages lost

Other improvements:
- Efficiency improvements to TMC2208/2209/2224 drivers for both main and tool boards
- Calls to debugPrintf use less stack than before
- Changes to expansion and tool board firmware to better support ATE
- Improvements to the SBC interface to resolve issues when Duet + SBC is used

RepRapFirmware 3.2-beta3.2
==========================

Upgrade notes:
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] You must also update expansion and tool board firmwares to 3.2beta3.2, otherwise heaters on expansion/tool boards will not work properly
- There have been no changes to DCS or DWC since release 3.2beta3, therefore those components will still report versoin 3.2beta3
- See also the Known Issues

Known issues:
- If you do not have a M307 command for a bed or chamber heater in your config.g file, you may get a "Temperature increasing too slowly" fault when you try to use that heater. Workaround: either tune that heater, or add the following command (with # replaced by the heater number) to config.g to restore the old behaviour: M307 H# A90 C700 D10

New features/changed behaviour:
- The M303 heater tuning algorithm and parameters have changed. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode?revisionid=HEAD#Section_M303_Run_heater_tuning.
- The M307 heater model parameters have changed, however existing M307 commands will continue to work. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode?revisionid=HEAD#Section_M307_Set_or_report_heating_process_parameters.

Bug fixes:
- PanelDue was not updated while the firmware was waiting for a heating or delay command to complete
- A M591 command with the C parameter not followed by a port name string caused the firmware to reset
- [Duet3 + expansion/tool boards] Errors when reading temperature sensors on expansion and tool boards sometimes caused the expansion or tool board to reset
- [Duet + SBC] Fixed issues with SBC communications

RepRapFirmware 3.2-beta3
========================

Upgrade notes:
- It is no longer permitted to create a filament monitor using M591 and subsequently to use M584 to change the driver that the extruder is mapped to
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] Changes have been made to the CAN message protocols, therefore you must upgrade tool and expansion boards to firmware 3.2beta3
- [Duet+SBC] Changes have been made to the DCS message protocols, therefore you must upgrade DSF to version 3.2beta3
- When new axes are created using M584, if no R parameter is specified then the default for axes ABCD is now rotational. Use the R0 parameter if you want them to be linear.

Known issues:
- PanelDue with firmware version 3.2.0 does not update the homed status wheh used with this RRF release. This will be fixed in a future PanelDueFirmware release.
- When running with attached SBC, any output generated from inside a while-loop in a GCode file or macro (e.g. from a GCode command or from an echo command) will not be shown until the while-loop has completed
- The original binary for Duet 3 EXP3HC expansion board in this release did not allow thermistors or PT1000 sensors to be configured on those boards. This release now has an updated binary (version 3.2beta3.1) that fixes this.
- If you use a M591 command with a C parameter that is not a quoted string, the firmware resets with a "Terminate called" software reset reason

New features/changed behaviour:
- When new axes are created using M584, if no R parameter is specified then the default for axes ABCD is now rotational. Use the R0 parameter if you want them to be linear.
- M584 has a new S parameter which specifies whether new axes created in the command are to be treated as linear (S0) or rotational (S1) for the purpose of feedrate calculation. This is separate from the R parameter, which specifies whether new axes are rotational or not. The default is to treat linear axes as linear and rotational axes as rotational. You only need to provide the S parameter if you want to change the way that the feed rate is applied.
- If a filament monitor is configured for an extruder, and subsequently M584 is used to assign that extruder to a different driver, then the filament monitor will be deleted automatically and a warning issued
- If a filament error occurs, RepRapFirmware now tries to run file sys/filament-error#.g where # is the extruder number in minimum-width format; or if that file is not found then file sys/filament-error.g. If neither file is found then it falls back to running sys/pause.g.
- [Duet+PanelDue] Status messages are sent to an attached PanelDue running firmware 3.2 during homing, heating tools etc.
- It is no longer necessary to separate multiple G- or M-commands on a single line with a space or tab character
- If the system runs out of memory, it will now reset and the Last Software Reset Reason reported by M122 will be "OutOfMemory"
- The M122 P102 and M122 P103 timing functions are more accurate and give more consistent results than in previous firmware versions
- M122 for expansion and tool boards now reports the bootloader version, if available
- Logging to file now has four log levels
    * 0: off (as previously no logging)
    * 1: warn (all previous logged messages are in this category)
    * 2: info (M117, M291, M292 and G10 fall into this category) and
    * 3: debug (everything else that generates output)
- M929 now takes values for the Snnn parameter from 0 (no logging) to 3 (maximum logging)
- M118 has a new Lnnn parameter to specify at which log level the message will be logged (default: DEBUG). Using L0 will prevent a message being copied to the log file.
- The speed of processing of GCodes received from USB has been improved, to match the speed of processing GCodes read from the SD card
- M453 and M452 no longer report the new machine mode. Use M450 after these commands if you want the machine mode to be reported.
- If a tool change is requested but changing tool would cause the Z max limit to be exceeded because of the changed tool Z offset, the tool change is now aborted
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] Filament monitors are now supported on Duet 3 expansion and tool boards. A filament monitor must be connected to the board that drives the extruder that it monitors.
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] Expansion and tool boards can now have their bootloaders updated via CAN using the command M997 B# S3 where # is the board address. The bootloader file is Duet3Bootloader-SAME5x.bin for the EXP3HC board, Duet3Bootloader-SAMC21.bin for the other expansion boards by Duet3D, and Duet3Bootloader-SAMMYC21.bin for the Sammy-C21 development board. These files are available at https://github.com/Duet3D/Duet3Bootloader/releases.
- [Duet + SBC] RepRapFirmware no longer goes into SBC mode if a SD card is inserted but can't be mounted, or if config.g is not found. This is to make diagnosis of SD card interface faults easier.

Object model changes:
- All types of filament monitors have a new field "status". The value is one of "noMonitor", "ok", "noDataReceived", "noFilament", "tooLittleMovement", "tooMuchMovement", "sensorError".
- Field "filamentPresent" is removed from those types of filament monitor that previously supported it. Use "status" instead.
- Laser, rotating magnet and pulsed filament still support the "calibrated" fields, but only for filament monitors connected to the main board
- Field "supports12864" in boards[0] has been renamed to "supportsDirectDisplay"
- Field "move.axes[].homed" is no longer flagged live, and it now remains the true homed status during a simulation

Bug fixes:
- M701 and M702 commands crashed the firmware with an assertion failure (new bug in 3.2beta2)
- G92 commands incremented seqs.move when they didn't need to (old bug)
- G92 Znn didn't clear zDatumSetByProbing (old bug)
- Some types of underrun in the movement queue were not reported
- The handling of out-of-buffer situations has been improved. Where a JSON response was expected, RRF will generally now return {"err":-1} if there was insufficient buffer space to satisfy the request.
- In RepRapFirmware mode, empty responses to commands were not suppressed. They are now suppressed except when the command came from HTTP or SBC.
- Feed rate calculations did not confirm to the NIST standard when the Z axis and one or more rotational axes were moving, but not X or Y. This affected CNC machines with rotational axes, and OpenPnP.
- When the machine was executing resume.g, the 'resuming' status was not reported in the object model
- [Duet 3] When using a LinearAnalog sensor, the readings returned were too high above the minimum reading by a factor of 4
- [Duet 3 + expansion/tool boards] The idle timeout was not always applied to remote drives, in particular to extruder drives
- [LPC/STM port, might affect Duets in rare situations] If hiccups occurred frequently and there was other activity in the system causing frequent high-priority interrupts, a watchdog timeout could occur
- [Duet+SBC] A buffer overflow might occur in the SBC interface code under conditions of heavy traffic
- [Duet+SBC] When nested macros were used, commands were sometimes executed out-of-order

RepRapFirmware 3.2-beta2
========================

Upgrade notes: none since 3.2-beta1

New features/changed behaviour:
- Supports Duet 3 Mini version 0.4 prototypes including CAN expansion. There are separate builds for version 0.2 and version 0.4 prototypes.
- Supports ST7567-based 12864 displays on Duet Maestro and Duet WiFi (thanks to SchmartMaker for writing the ST7567 driver code)
- Supports PanelDue 3.2 better, in particular updating of displayed data while waiting for heating etc.
- Any attempt to use G28 within a homing file now results in a specific error message
- Improved the instructions displayed when M303 heater tuning finishes
- M571 command accepts Q as an alternative to F for the PWM frequency
- M584 commands are now checked for out-of-range driver numbers
- M150 commands are now queued to sync them with movement commands
- M111 supports CAN module debug

Object model changes:
- Variable boards[n] for expansion boards now includes the maxMotors value
- Added state.msUpTime. This is the milliseconds part of upTime. When using the HTTP rr_model call or the M409 command, if the response includes both state.upTime and state.msUpTime then these two values both relate to the same instant when the command started searching the object model.

Internal changes:
- A separate task is used to communicate with an attached Single Board Computer. This is expected to resolve a number of issues.

Bug fixes:
- G2 and G3 commands with R parameter always drew the longer of the two possible arcs. Now they draw the shorter one if the R parameter is positive, or the longer one if it is negative.
- Duet 3 Mini only: certain types of error accessing the SD card would cause the firmware to reset due to "Stuck in spin loop".
- The Error Status word was incorrectly prefixed by 0x02 in beta1 instead of just 0x
- If M918 was run multiple times, available RAM was lost because of a memory leak
- When doing a simple G30 command the the probe type was BLTouch, the deploy and retract macro files were each run twice
- A layer change was detected incorrectly if a travel move at an unusual height included retraction
- [Duet 2 or 3 with attached SBC only] The height map parameters passed by the SBC were not range-checked

RepRapFirmware 3.2-beta1
========================

Upgrade notes:
- In GCode commands, numeric parameters of the form "0xdddd" where dddd are hex digits are no longer supported. Use {0xdddd} instead.
- If you are using the M453 command to configure spindle motors and switch the firmware into CNC mode, you will need to change this command because the parameters have changed.
- If you are using object model field move.workspaceNumber in conditional GCode, you should preferably replace it by (move.workplaceNumber + 1). Note the different name, and that the new workplaceNumber is 0-based (so it can be used to index the workplaceOffsets arrays directly) whereas workspaceNumber was 1-based. We plan to remove workspaceNumber in a future release.
- If you are using object model field sensors.zprobes[].temperatureCoefficient in conditional GCode, you should preferably replace it by temperatureCoefficients[0]. We plan to remove temperatureCoefficient in a future release.
- Default thermistor parameters for all builds of RRF3 are now: T100000 B4725 C7.06e-8. These match the thermistor used by E3D better than the old default, which had B4388 C0. In the unlikely event that your M308 line had a C parameter but no B parameter, you will need to add B4388 to get the previous behaviour.
- If you configure a Z probe using multiple M558 commands instead of a single one, you must make sure that oonly the first one has a P parameter. This is because M558 with a P parameter now sets default values before processing the other parameters of the M558 command.
- [Duet 3] if using an attached DotStar LED strip then you now need to use M150 with the X parameter to specify the LED strip type. This is because the default type is now Neopixel.

New features/changed behaviour:
- Support for connecting the Ethernet adapter socket of Duet Ethernet to SBC instead, using separate firmware build
- A default filename is no longer provided in the M559 and M560 commands, so the P parameter must always be used
- Numeric literals in GCode meta commands and in expressions enclosed by { } can now be in hex (0x prefix) or binary (0b prefix)
- The minimum value for the P parameter of M584 is reduced from 3 to 2 so that the Z axis can be hidden
- M906, M913 and M918 commands now wait for movement to stop, except when they are used in the power fail script
- G29 with no S parameter now runs file sys/mesh.g if it exists; otherwise it behaves like G29 S0 as before
- Drivers number of the form 0.# where # represents one or more decimal digits are now supported even on board that don't support CAN
- The resurrect.g file now records which objects on the build plate have been cancelled
- Duet 3 Mini 5+ WiFi and Ethernet prototype boards v0.2 are now supported
- Added L (calibration factor) parameter to laser filament monitor configuration
- Increased the number of stack words displayed in the software reset data. The number of wear-levelling slots stored is reduced from 4 to 3.
- Added M584 R parameter to indicate whether newly created axes are continuous rotation axes or not
- M486 now confirms when an object is cancelled or resumed
- Default thermistor parameters for all builds of RRF3 are now T100000 B4725 C7.06e-8. These match the thermistor used by E3D better than the old defaults.
- The parameters for M453 have changed. The frequency parameter is now Q (to match M950) instead of F. You can configure up to 3 ports to control each spindle. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M453_in_RepRapFirmware_3_2_and_later.
- In the M122 report, unused stack for each task is now reported in dwords, not bytes
- Z probe trigger height second order temperature compensation is now supported. To use it, specify a 2-element array as the temperature coefficient, e.g. "M558 ... C0.01:0.0005".
- M558 with a P parameter now always creates a new Z probe object, which means that all the other M558 values are set to default values before processing the other M558 parameters
- M581 trigger condition parameter now supports a new value R2 which means trigger only if not printing from SD card
- [Duet Maestro] M308 L and H parameters are now supported.
- [Duet Maestro and Duet 3] Added M308 S# H999 for open-circuit thermistor input calibration, and M308 S# L999 for short-circuit calibration. The calibration values are stored in non-volatile memory. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Calibrating_thermistor_and_PT1000_readings.
- [Duet 3] Added support for second UART (using the IO_1 pins) on Duet 3 MB6HC. New message type (P5) added to M118 command.
- [Duet 3] Default LED strip type is now Neopixel not DotStar
- [Duet 3] M915 with just P and/or axis parameters now reports the belt speed in mm/sec that corresponds to the coolStep threshold
- [Duet 3] Z probing is now abandoned if the probe is remote and cannot be contacted
- [in progress] Support for ST7567-based 12864 displays on Duet Maestro
- [in progress] Support for ST7567-based 12864 displays on Duet WiFi/Ethernet
- [Duet 3 expansion and tool boards] Increased performance, in particular the maximum step rate is higher than before
- [Duet 3 expansion and tool boards] Software reset data is now stored in NVRAM and reported by M122
- [Duet 3 expansion and tool boards] Added M122 P102, P1005 and P1006 functions

Object model and expression evaluation changes:
- Added move.workplaceNumber to the object model. This is intended to repace move.workspaceNumber, but is 0-based instead of 1-based.
- Added temperatureCoefficients array to the Z probe object model. For backwards compatibility, temperatureCoefficient is still supported for the time being and is equivalent to temperatureCoefficients[0].
- Added minRpm to the spindle object model
- Spindle current/configured/max RPM were being output to 7 decimal places in object model queries. Now they are reported as integers.
- Added lastStopHeight to the Z probe object model
- Added calibrationFactor to the laser filament monitor object model
- Support comparing a value of any type that has no literals (DateTime, IPAddress, MAC address, DriverID) with a string
- Support DateTime - DateTime, DateTime + int, DateTime - int
- Support T{expression} commands
- Added random(nn) function

Bug fixes:
- Fixed issue with G29 S1 on Duet 3 with attached SBC causing the print to fail if any if the probe points had been unreachable when the height map was probed
- Fixed a buffer overflow when the number of filaments reported by PrusaSlic3r exceeds the maximum number of supported extruders
- Fixed bug in GetProportionDone that might have caused an incorrect extrusion amount for the first move after restarting a print following a power failure
- The output from M207 without parameters was truncated when there were 4 or more tools
- If a G31 command defined new values in terms of existing G31 values from the object model, then incorrect values could be set due to the new values being computed and stored multiple times
- The M409 response didn't end in newline and was invalid JSON if RRF ran out of output buffers. Now RRF returns {"err":-1} if it runs out of buffers, and the response is always terminated by newline to help clients recover from errors.
- Object model variable seqs.spindles was not updated when the configuredRpm of a spindle was changed
- Loading IAP during a firmware upgrade might fail on Duet 2 if a filament monitor or fan tacho was active
- The PWM frequency for heaters was supposed to be limited to 1KHz but this check was no longer being performed
- [Duet 3 with attached SBC] When an array parameter (e.g. M92 E value) had more than one element but less than the maximum number, the last element was replicated to fill the array. This was inconsistent with non-SBC behaviour, which only pads the array when a single element is provided.
- [Duet 3] Fixed a bug that caused strange behaviour during homing in some configurations when axis motors were connected to expansion boards
- [Duet 3] When attached to a SBC, M29 commands received locally are now sent to the SBC for processing
- [Duet 3] M915 with just P and/or axis parameters did not report the coolStep threshold (T parameter) correctly
- [Duet 3] DHCP requests were being made made much too often when the DHCP lease time was long e.g. 1 hour or more

RepRapFirmware 3.1.1
====================

Recommended compatible firmware:
- DuetWebControl 3.1.1
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23 (same as for previous RC)
- Duet Software Framework version 3.1.1 (for Duet 3/Raspberry Pi users)
- Duet 3 expansion board and tool board firmware 3.1.0
- PanelDueFirmware 1.24

Upgrade notes:
- Available RAM is slightly reduced in this version. This won't affect most users, however if you are running a Duet WiFi or Duet Ethernet with a large number of tools/heaters/sensors etc. then check that the Never Used RAM in the M122 report is comfortably above zero.
- If you are upgrading from a version earlier than 3.1.0, see also the upgrade notes for version 3.1.0.

New features/changed behaviour:
- Maximum GCode line length is increased from 160 to 200 characters
- The number of decimal places reported for axis minimum and maximum limits from the object model is increased from 1 to 2
- Duet 3: M122 now says whether the Duet is running in SBC or standalone mode
- Added object model field 'state.time'. This will be null if the date/time hasn't been set, otherwise a string in ISO format such as 2020-05-10T07:59:31.
- Object model variables which represent a date and time (e.g. file last modified time) are now in ISO format, i.e. "2020-05-10T07:59:31" instead of "2020-05-10 07:59:31". This is for compatibility with DSF and with the way they are returned by M409.

Bug fixes:
- In some configurations the firmware crashed occasionally because the NETWORK task stack overflowed
- Changes to Z probe parameters made by G31, M558 and M851 were not reported to DCS or DWC
- Duet 3 with SBC: G29 (optionally with S1 parameter) rewrote the old height map to the virtual SD card instead of writing the new one
- Duet 3 with SBC: certain commands completed in the wrong order
- G92 commands did not updated seqs.move

RepRapFirmware 3.1.0
====================

Recommended compatible firmware:
- DuetWebControl 3.1.0
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23 (same as for previous RC)
- Duet Software Framework version 3.1.0 (for Duet 3/Raspberry Pi users)
- Duet 3 expansion board and tool board firmware 3.1.0
- PanelDueFirmware 1.24

Upgrade notes:
- **If you are upgrading from RepRapFirmware 2.x then you will need to make substantial changes to your config.g file.** See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/RepRapFirmware_3_overview#Section_Summary_of_what_you_need_to_do_to_convert_your_configuration_and_other_files for details. Also you must upgrade to the 3.0 release first.
- All PanelDue users: the PanelDue connector (or IO_0 on Duet 3) is no longer dedicated to PanelDue, therefore if you connect a PanelDue to this port you must use the following command in config.g to enable it: M575 P1 S1 B57600. You can use baud rates other than 57600, however the IAP files all assume 57600 baud; therefore if you use another baud rate then PanelDue will not display firmware update progress.
- If you use M581 commands you must replace the C parameter by R
- Tool change files are now run even if the axes have not been homed. If you don't want certain parts to run when axes have not been homed, use conditional GCode in the tool change file.
- After a tool change, the user Z coordinate is restored immediately instead of by the end of the next G0 or G1 command. 
- Duet WiFi, Ethernet and Maestro: a default bed heater is no longer assigned, so you need to use M140 H0 in config.g if you want to replicate the previous behaviour. The online configurator already generates this command automatically when you configure a bed heater. Any M143 H0 command must come later in config.g than the M140 H0 command, because M140 resets the temperature limit for the heater to the default for bed heaters.
- The I (invert) parameter of M558 has been removed. If you were using I1 then you will need to invert the pin name instead.
- Legacy 5-point bed compensation is no longer supported
- The tool number (P parameter) in a M563 command must now be in the range 0-49
- Duet 3: If you were using M308 H or L parameters for thermistors attached to a Duet 3 main board, you will need to adjust those values
- The parameters to M577 have changed. See  https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M577_RepRapFirmware_3_01RC2_and_later.
- The parameters to M581 have changed. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M581_RepRapFirmware_3_01RC2_and_later.
- The P parameter to M143 now has a different meaning. Also the X (sensor) parameter has been replaced by T. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M143_Maximum_heater_temperature.

Known issues and limitations:
- If you execute a tool change at a Z value close to maximum then this could result in at attempt to exceed maximum Z depending on the difference between the old and new Z tool offsets.
- Z probe types 1, 2 and 5 are only supported for Z probe 0, and if using Duet 3 only for a probe connected to the main board. All other Z probes must be of type 8 or 9.
- Duet 3: an endstop switch or Z probe connected to the main board will not stop movement of a motor on an expansion board unless a motor on the main board is also moving
- Duet 3: when updating the firmware on one or more tool boards or expansion boards, after the updates have completed you must reset the main board or at least run config.g in order to reconfigure the expansion or tool boards
- Duet 3: additional limitations apply to systems with expansion and/or tool boards. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duet_3_firmware_configuration_limitations.

New features:
- The **if**, **elif**, **else**, **while**, **break**, **continue**, **echo** and **abort** GCode meta commands are implemented, along with expression evaluation. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/GCode_Meta_Commands.
- The RepRapFirmware Object Model has been implemented. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Object_Model_of_RepRapFirmware.
- M409 and a corresponding HTTP call rr_model have been added, to allow parts of the object model to be queried
- The parameters to G- and M-commands can now be expressions and can use values retrieved from the object model
- M486 object cancellation is now implemented. Object labels are read from comments in the file if provided. When printing from SD card the object model includes subtree "job.build" to describe the known objects, so that a future version of Duet Web Control will be able to offer an object cancellation interface. Caution: although the code has been designed to handle multi-tool machines, it has not yet been tested with prints that use more than one tool.
- The PanelDue connector (or IO_0 on Duet 3) is no longer dedicated to PanelDue. When not used for PanelDue, its two pins are available for use by GPIO, endstops etc. On Duet WiFi/Ethernet/Maestro they are called "urx0" and "utx0".
- The PanelDue port (or IO_0 on Duet 3) can now be configure to operate in raw (non-PanelDue) serial mode using command M575 P1 S2 B### where ### is the required baud rate. In this mode it will default to Marlin-type responses.
- There is now a daemon GCode channel, which looks for and executes file sys/daemon.g. This can be used to execute regular tasks. If the end of the file is reached, or the file is not found, it delays for 1 second and starts again.
- Experimental support for NeoPixel LED strips has been added for Duet 3. See the M150 X parameter.
- Multiple Z probes are supported. M558, G29 and G30 now accept an optional K parameter to specify which Z probe to use. Each Z probe can now have its own deploy and retract files. Z probe number # (where # counts up from zero) looks first for deployprobe#.g and if that is not found it falls back to deployprobe.g. Similarly it uses retractprobe#.g in preference to retractprobe.g. The M401 (deploy probe) and M402 (retract probe) commands now accept an optional P parameter which is the Z probe number to deploy or retract, default 0.
- M207 retraction parameters are now settable on a per-tool basis. The P parameter selects which tool to set. M207 with no P parameter applies the parameters provided to all existing tools. Retraction settings in the object model are moved from extruders[].retraction to tools[].retraction.
- General purpose inputs may now be configured using M950 J# C"pin-name". These are used by M577 and M581. Their states may be queried in the object model. On Duet 3 they may refer to pins on expansion boards and tool boards as well as pins on the main board.
- File runonce.g is now supported. If this file is present at startup, it is run after running config.g and activating the network, and then deleted.
- The MakeDirectory and RenameFile local SD card functions now create the full path recursively if necessary
- Duet 3: M143 now works for heaters on expansion boards and tool boards
- Implemented M952, which is used to set the CAN addresses of tool boards, and exceptionally to alter the CAN bus timing

Changed behaviour (major):
- The M581 C parameter (condition) is now replaced by R, in order to allow triggering from a C endstop
- Duet 3: firmware updates initiated from SBC now send the same USB and PanelDue messages as other types of firmware update
- Tool change files are now run even if the axes have not been homed. If you don't want certain parts to run when axes have not been homed, use conditional GCode in the tool change file.
- After a tool change, the user Z coordinate is restored immediately instead of by the end of the next G0 or G1 command. 
- If a HTTP request is received but insufficient output buffers are available, a HTTP 503 error code is now returned immediately instead of waiting to see if buffers become available and/or discarding response messages. A client receiving a 503 request should call rr_reply to get and flush any pending responses before making any other type of request.
- The "laser" field in the rr_status and M408 responses and in state.laserPwm in the object model are now the power that will be used for the next G1, G2 or G3 move instead of the current laser power. This is to allow user interfaces to warn that the laser will turn on as soon as movement starts. New object model field move.current.laserPwm gives the current laser PWM.
- A default bed heater is never assigned. In previous 3.01 release candidates, heater 0 was the default bed heater in the Duet WiFi/Ethernet and Maestro builds.
- When pausing a job in CNC mode, the spindle speed is now saved in restore point 1
- The M308 thermistor H and L parameters on Duet 3 main boards have been re-scaled to match the scaling used on Duet 3 expansion and tool boards.
- If the macro stack depth is exceeded, the current macros in the stack are abandoned; and if the macro was called from a GCode print file, that file is abandoned too
- Round brackets in GCode lines are no longer treated as enclosing comments if the machine is not in CNC mode
- A G4 command will no longer wait for all movement to complete if the input channel executing the G4 has not commanded any motion since it last waited for motion to stop. This is to allow G4 to be used to introduced delays in trigger and daemon GCode files, without causing motion to stop. M400 can still be used to wait for motion to stop.
- The I (invert) parameter of M558 has been removed
- The parameters to M577 have changed. See  https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M577_RepRapFirmware_3_01RC2_and_later.
- The parameters to M581 have changed. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M581_RepRapFirmware_3_01RC2_and_later.
- The P parameter to M143 now has a different meaning. Also the X (sensor) parameter has been replaced by T. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Gcode#Section_M143_Maximum_heater_temperature.
Duet 3: Z probes of types 8 (unfiltered digital) and 9 (BLTouch) connected to expansion boards and tool boards are supported
- When tuning a heater using M303 H# the S parameter is now mandatory
- The rr_connect message returns additional field "apiLevel":1 if it succeeds. This can be used as an indication that the rr_model command is supported.
- In Laser mode, GCode lines with coordinates etc. but no G or M command are now accepted if the most recent command was G0, G1, G2, or G3. This was already the case in CNC mode.
- The speed factor (M220) is no longer applied to extruder-only moves or to movement commands in system or user macro files

Changed behaviour (minor):
- Previously, if a response for an over-long filename was received by the HTTP server, a "Filename too long" error message was generated and no response to the HTTP command was returned. Now, a 404 response is returned, and a message warning about a possible virus attack is generated unless the filename looks like an OCSP request.
- M575 P0 indicates whether the USB interface is in the connected state
- M575 P1 says if the aux channel is disabled
- M122 Telnet responder line now gives the number of Telnet sessions
- On Duet WiFi/Ethernet the stepper driver microstep counters are checked and cleared whenever VIN power is applied or reapplied. This is to combat the phantom stepping that sometimes occurs.
- HTTP command rr_gcode with no gcode parameter now returns the buffer space, and rr_gcode with an empty gcode parameter no longer adds an empty command to the buffer
- Duet WiFi/Ethernet: added I2C transaction count and transactions/minute to M122 diagnostics
- Added longest SD card read time (since last M122) to diagnostics
- Longest SD card write time in diagnostics now excludes delays inserted by RRF between retries and the CRC calculation time
- When in laser mode, at the end of a SD file print the laser power for the next move is set to zero automatically even if the job file didn't request it
- The heater fault messages have been improved (thanks gtj0)
- Recent versions of S3D changed the print time comment when the print time is at least 1 hour but less than 2 hours. RRF now recognises the new format.
- M308 thermistor H and L parameters are now constrained to the range -128 to +127.
- M915 now reports the axis or extruder speed that corresponds to the fullsteps/second value of the H parameter
- Increased maximum number of axes on Duet WiFi/Ethernet from 9 to 10
- Increased maximum stack/macro file depth from 5 to 7
- Duet 3: an emergency stop now tries to stop all CAN-connected expansion boards and tool boards
- When a GCode channel locks movement and waits for movement to stop, if there is no movement but moves have been queued, those moves are now executed immediately. Previously there could be a short delay before they were executed.
- On Duet 3, increased maximum heaters per tool from 4 to 8, maximum extruders per tool from 6 to 8, maximum bed heaters from 9 to 12, maximum total heaters to 32 and maximum extra heater protection instances to 32

Bug fixes:
- Duet 3: the default value written to the TMC5160 PWMCONF register did not match the default value for that chip
- Duet 3 with SBC: Fixed a very small memory leak when DCS sent a height map to RRF
- Duet 3 with SBC: Fixed loss of output buffers when the USB interface became disconnected and generic messages were generated
- Duet 3 with SBC: Array parameters in G- and M-commands were not bounds checked
- Duet 3 with SBC: File-related commands sent from USB ior from a PanelDue connected to the Duet now work (if sending from a PanelDue then it must have firmware 1.24 or later)
- Using the M591 (configure height following mode) command caused a firmware crash and reset in some configurations
- Duet WiFi/Ethernet + DueX5: depending on the configuration, the response to a M122 command sent from DWC 2.1.5 might be discarded due to insufficient output buffers
- Duet 3 + SBC: when sending commands from USB or a raw aux port on the Duet and in Marlin response mode, certain commands (e.g. G28, G32) did not return the "ok" response
- Duet 3 + SBC: pauses commanded by filament monitors sometimes caused a system hang or other undesirable behaviour
- Pause and resume sometimes caused a small Z shift if bed compensation was in use and the tool had an X or Y offset
- If you used the M581 C parameter and you had a C axis, it would trigger on changes to the state of the C endstop
- Disabling a trigger response to an input or endstop using the C-1 parameter didn't work
- Duet 3 with SBC: SPI timeout errors were sometimes reported when a command used a CAN address for which no board was present
- When the minimum extrusion or retraction temperature was changed using M302, the updated values were not reported in the rr_status and M308 responses (this is long-standing bug)
- Non-movement commands that needed to be synchronised to the movement queue were sometimes executed too early
- M3 and M5 commands in laser mode were sometimes executed too early, typically by 1 move
- Under some conditions a PanelDue or similar client might not fetch all the waiting responses, leading to responses being delayed or lost, or temporarily running out of output buffers
- Empty responses to commands were being sent to PanelDue instead of being suppressed
- If nested config.g files were used (e.g. because M505 was used to change the system folder) then the effect of M83, G1 Fxxx etc. commands in the nested file were lost
- If an extruder-only move specified a feed rate, and the following printing move didn't specify a feed rate because it happened to be the same as the feed rate of the extruder-only move, then the speed factor wouldn't get applied to that move. Likewise if a GCode file used a G1 Fxxx line with no movement in order to dset the feed rate of the following moves, the speed factor would not be applied to those moves.
- M409 incorrectly allowed the '.' to be omitted between the closing square bracket of an index and the following field name
- On Duet 3 in standalone mode, on the Ethernet interface the limit on the number of MDNS services was set too low, so only the 'echo' service was created
- The seconds in the last-modified times of files were reported incorrectly (this was a long-standing bug)
- In five-bar SCARA kinematics, the X and Y motors were not treated as continuous rotation axes (thanks bondus)
- When M32 was run a second time, the line numbering was not reset
- Round-robin scheduling of GCode input sources has been restored so that no channel can monopolise the motion system
- On some Duet 3 boards, axes were not flagged as homed when VIN power was lost but 5V power remained
- When using the M109 command, the firmware did not prevent you from setting temperatures that exceeded the limit set by M143
- The RPM of non-thermostatic fans with tachos wasn't reported continuously
- When an under-voltage event occurs, all axes are now flagged as not homed
- The maximum step rate possible was reduced in earlier RRF3 releases. Some of that loss has been restored.
- When the C (temperature coefficient) parameter was used in the G31 command, if the temperature could not be read from the sensor specified in the H parameter then the error message was not clear; and it didn't allow time for the sensor to become ready in case it had only just been configured.
- The M917 command didn't work on Duet 3 and Duet Maestro.
- Fixed two instances of possible 1-character buffer overflow in class OutputBuffer
- If no heaters were configured, one spurious heater was reported in the status response
- On delta printers, M564 S0 didn't allow movement outside the print radius defined in M665
- On Duet 3 with attached SBC, when a job was paused and then cancelled, a spurious move sometimes occurred

RepRapFirmware 3.0
==================

Recommended compatible firmware:
- Duet Web Control 2.0.4
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23
- DuetSoftwareFramework 1.2.2.0
- Duet3Firmware_EXP3HC 3.0

Upgrade notes:
- **If you are upgrading from RepRapFirmware 2.x then you will need to make substantial changes to your config.g file.** See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/RepRapFirmware_3_overview#Section_Summary_of_what_you_need_to_do_to_convert_your_configuration_and_other_files for details.
- Duet Maestro users: the M917 command does not work in this release. If you use M917 in config.g or any other files, we suggest you comment it out all M917 commands until you can upgrade to version 3.01.

The remaining items affect users of RepRapFirmware 3.0 beta (but not RC) versions:
- Endstop type S0 (active low switch) is no longer supported in M574 commands. Instead, use type S1 and invert the input by prefixing the pin name with '!'.
- If you are using Duet 3 expansion or tool boards, you must upgrade those to 3.0 too
- You should also upload the new IAP file for your system. You will need it when upgrading firmware in future. These files are called Duet2CombinedIAP.bin, DuetMaestroIAP.bin, Duet3_SBCiap_MB6HC.bin (for Duet 3+SBC) and Duet3_SDiap.bin (for Duet 3 standalone systems). Leave the old IAP files on your system, they have different names and you will need them again if you downgrade to older firmware.
- Duet 3 users: there is no longer a default bed heater. To use Heater 0 as the bed heater, put M140 H0 in config.g (later in config.g than your M950 H0 command).

Known limitations:
- Duet 3 users: connector IO_0 of the MB6HC board is currently reserved for PanelDue. We recommend that you do not use it for any other purpose.
- Duet 3 users: support for expansion boards has some limitations. See https://duet3d.dozuki.com/Wiki/Duet_3_firmware_configuration_limitations for details.
- Duet Maestro and Duet 3 users: the M917 command does not work properly and must not be used.

Bug fixes since 3.0RC2:
- Fixed issue where a missing start.g could disrupt the G-code flow with an attached SBC
- When RRF requested a macro file but had to wait for the SBC to connect, the final code replies to DSF were omitted

- Fix for M25 while tool changing is is progress
- Fix for unexpected diagonal moves during tool changes
- Use of M950 to configure heater numbers greater than 5 on expansion boards caused sensors to disappear
- The response to M308 with just a S parameter didn't include the sensor name or last reading if the sensor was connected to a Duet 3 expansion board
- The G31 response now displays trigger height to 3 decimal places instead of 2
- When printing from file on a Duet 3 with attached Raspberry Pi, under some conditions an attempt to retrieve the file position caused RRF to crash

RepRapFirmware 3.0RC1
=====================

Recommended compatible firmware:
- Duet Web Control 2.0.4
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23
- DuetSoftwareFramework 1.2
- Duet3Firmware_EXP3HC 3.0RC1
- Duet3Firmware_Tool1LC 3.0RC1

Known issues:
- An endstop switch connected to a Duet 3 main board may only be used to home an axis if at least one motor controlling that axis is driven by the main board
- Various Duet 3 expansion board features are not fully implemented. See the RRF3 Limitations document on the wiki.
- After installing new expansion or tool board firmware or resetting an expansion or tool board, you must reset the main board or at least run config.g using M98. Otherwise the expansion/tool board configuration will not match the settings expected by the main board.

Upgrade notes:
- Endstop type S0 (active low switch) is no longer supported in M574 commands. Instead, use type S1 and invert the input by prefixing the pin name with '!'.
- If you are using Duet 3 expansion or tool boards, you must upgrade those to 3.0RC1 too
- Duet 3+SBC users must use DSF 1.1.0.5 or a compatible later version with this version of RRF
- You should also upload the new IAP file for your system. You will need it when upgrading firmware in future. These files are called Duet2CombinedIAP.bin, DuetMaestroIAP.bin, Duet3_SBCiap_MB6HC.bin (for Duet 3+SBC) and Duet3_SDiap.bin (for Duet 3 standalone systems). You can leave the old IAP files on your system, they have different names and you will need them if you downgrade to earlier firmware.
- Duet 3 users: there is no longer a default bed heater. To use Heater 0 as the bed heater, put M140 H0 in config.g (later in config.g than your M950 H0 command).

Feature changes since beta 12:
- Duet 3 only: Switch-type endstops connected to expansion boards are supported
- Current position is no longer shown for pulse-type filament monitors, because it was meaningless and nearly always zero
- Calibration data for pulse-type filament monitors is no longer displayed by M122 (same as for laser and magnetic filament monitors). Use M591 to report the calibration data.
- Max bed heaters increased to 9 on Duet 3, 2 on Duet Meastro (still 4 on Duet WiFi/Ethernet)
- Max chamber heaters increased to 4 on Duet 3 and on Duet WiFi/Ethernet
- CRC calculation has been speeded up, which improves the speed of file uploads in standalone mode when CRC checking is enabled in DWC
- G1 H1 E moves (stopping on motor stall) are now implemented
- rr_config and M408 S5 responses now include field "sysdir" which is the system files folder set using M505
- M950 P, M950 S, M42 and M280 are implemented on expansion boards
- B parameter added to M408 to query expansion boards (for expansion board ATE)
- M122 P parameter is passed to the expansion board if the B parameter is present and selects an expansion board (for ATE)

Bug fixes:
- Duet 3 only: Files uploaded in standalone modes were frequently corruption during uploading, resulting in CRC mismatches reported
- If a print that was sliced using absolute extrusion mode was resurrected, unwanted extrusion occurred just before the print was resumed
- Bed compensation did not take account of the XY offset of the printing nozzle from the head reference point
- When using SCARA kinematics the calculation of the minimum achievable radius was incorrect. Depending on the B parameter of the M667 command, this could result in spurious "Intermediate position unreachable" errors, or non-extruding G1 moves being turned into G0 moves.
- A badly-formed GCode file that returned the layer height or object height as nan or inf caused DWC to disconnect because of a JSON parse failure
- M579 scale factors were not applied correctly to G2 and G3 arc moves
- M119 crashed if an axis had no endstop
- Filament handling didn't work on Duet 3+SBC
- If a homing move involved only motors connected to Duet 3 expansion boards and the corresponding endstop was already triggered, the homing move started anyway and didn't stop
- Stall detect homing works properly
- If an attempt to create a switch-type endstop using M574 failed because the specified pin wasn't available, this resulted in a partically-configured switch endstop

RepRapFirmware 3.0beta12
========================
Recommended compatible firmware:
- Duet Web Control 2.0.4
- DuetWiFiServer 1.23
- DuetSoftwareFramework 1.1.0.5

Feature changes since beta 11:
- Duet 3 0.6 and 1.0: pin io8.out is no longer PWM-capable because of a resource clash. If you have connected a BLTouch to IO8, please move it to IO7 and adjust config.g accordingly.
- Duet 3 all revisions: improved the temperature reading accuracy at low temperatures for thermistors connected to the main board (typically it used to read several degrees low)
- Duet 3 all revisions: M308 L and H parameters are supported for thermistors and PT1000 sensors connected to the main board. They should only be used if you have suitable fixed resistors to use for calibration.
- DHT sensors are now supported (thanks wilriker)
- M115 P parameter is now only implemented on those builds that support multiple board types, and only when running config.g at startup
- M500 now accepts optional P10 parameter to force it to save the G10 tool offsets (thanks wilriker). It can be combined with P31 by using M500 P10:31.

Bug fixes:
- Duet 3 0.6 and 1.0: PWM output on io4.out and io5.out now works
- Duet 3 0.6 and 1.0: pin io6.out was incorrectly marked as PWM-capable
- Duet 3 all revisions: Driver 5 on main board didn't generate temperature warnings
- Duet 3 all revisions: updating expansion boards didn't work when running in standalone mode if the USB port was connected to a PC but no terminal emulator was running
- Duet 3 all revisions: the drivers are no longer shut down when VIN exceeds 29V
- In beta 11, control of BLTouch probes was unreliable because of glitches on the control output pin
- Homing sometimes didn't work, especially when endstops switches were already triggered at the start of the homing move
- M308 S# with no other parameters didn't report the sensor details
Known issues:

- Duet 3 all revisions: file uploading via the local Ethernet port is unreliable (this is the case in previous firmware versions too). To guard against this, always enable CRC checking in DWC 2.0.4.
- Extruder stall detection (G1 H1 E moves) is not implemented
- Stall detection endstops don't work properly if you home multiple aes at the same time
